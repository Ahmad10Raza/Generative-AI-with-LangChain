### 📘 **LangGraph Learning Roadmap / Table of Contents**

#### 1. 🧠 **Introduction to LangGraph**

* What is LangGraph?
* Differences between LangGraph and LangChain
* When and why to use LangGraph

---

#### 2. ⚙️ **LangGraph Core Concepts**

* Graph-based reasoning and control flow
* Nodes, Edges, and State
* Step functions (synchronous & asynchronous)
* Single-path vs. multi-path logic
* State object design (memory, variables, etc.)

---

#### 3. 🛠️ **LangGraph Setup**

* Installing `langgraph` and related dependencies
* Creating your first LangGraph project
* Folder and module structure best practices

---

#### 4. 🔄 **Basic Graph Construction**

* Define nodes (functions or chains)
* Define edges (transitions)
* Add conditional routing
* Setting up inputs/outputs
* Running your graph with `.invoke()` and `.astream()`

---

#### 5. 🧩 **Integration with LangChain**

* Using `LCEL` (LangChain Expression Language) with LangGraph
* Integrating chains and tools as LangGraph nodes
* Example: LangGraph with OpenAI, ChatOpenAI, tools, memory, agents

---

#### 6. 💬 **Conversational Graphs**

* Implementing memory-aware chat agents
* Using `ConversationBufferMemory` and other memory classes
* Multi-turn conversations and user input routing

---

#### 7. 🕵️‍♂️ **Multi-Agent Workflows**

* Creating multiple agents with different roles
* Agent collaboration using message-passing
* Role-playing agents (e.g., coder, reviewer, planner)
* Example: Autonomous team of AI agents solving a task

---

#### 8. 📦 **LangGraph with Tools and Retrieval**

* LangGraph + Tools + LangChain toolkits
* Adding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Graph nodes for search, vector store lookup, summarization

---

#### 9. 🚦 **Advanced Routing & Control**

* Conditional branching
* Stateful decision-making (based on output or memory)
* Timeout and retry logic
* Looping (recurrent) flows

---

#### 10. 🎮 **Interactivity & Streamed Output**

* Async graphs and streamed responses
* Using `astream()` to stream intermediate steps
* Building interactive apps with Streamlit or Gradio + LangGraph

---

#### 11. 🚀 **Deploying LangGraph Apps**

* FastAPI wrapper for LangGraph apps
* Background tasks and persistence
* Hosting on cloud platforms (Render, Vercel, Hugging Face Spaces)

---

#### 12. 📚 **Case Studies & Real-World Examples**

* Multi-agent document QA
* Autonomous code generation bot
* Research assistant with memory + tool use
* Decision-making advisor system

---

#### 13. 🧪 **Testing, Debugging, and Observability**

* Debugging flow logic
* Logging each node execution
* Visualizing the graph
* Best practices for observability

---

#### 14. 🔒 **Security and Limitations**

* Rate limiting and safety
* Preventing infinite loops
* LangGraph limitations and workarounds

---

#### 15. 🧰 **Bonus: LangGraph + Open Source Ecosystem**

* LangGraph with Haystack, Chroma, Weaviate, Qdrant
* Integrating LangGraph with Hugging Face models
* Combining LangGraph with your custom APIs
