    "LangGraph introduces a **graph-based programming model** for building LLM applications. At its core, it allows you to define **nodes**, **edges**, and **state transitions** — just like a **finite state machine**, but supercharged for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔁 1. **Graph-based Reasoning and Control Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph uses a **directed graph** where:\n",
    "- **Nodes** = steps in your app (e.g., function calls, tool usage, LLM invocations)\n",
    "- **Edges** = conditions or transitions between steps\n",
    "- **State** = shared memory that flows through nodes and evolves over time\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "graph = StateGraph(StateType)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"step_1\", step_1_fn)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"step_2\", step_2_fn)\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"step_1\", \"step_2\")\n",
    "graph.set_entry_point(\"step_1\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 2. **State Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph revolves around **stateful applications**:\n",
    "- The **state** is a Python `dict` (or `TypedDict`) that holds data passed between nodes.\n",
    "- Each node can **read, update, or return** the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def step_1(state):\n",
    "    state[\"message\"] = \"Hello from step 1\"\n",
    "    return state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> This design makes your app **modular**, **testable**, and **dynamic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔀 3. **Conditional Branching**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph supports branching logic:\n",
    "- Each node can return a **next step name** based on a condition\n",
    "- Enables decision trees, routing logic, feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def router(state):\n",
    "    if state[\"intent\"] == \"search\":\n",
    "        return \"search_node\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"fallback_node\"\n",
    "\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\"router\", router, {\n",
    "    \"search_node\": \"search_node\",\n",
    "    \"fallback_node\": \"fallback_node\"\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔄 4. **Looping and Recursion**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph allows **loops** natively. Nodes can route back to previous ones, creating dynamic re-evaluation and feedback-based workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"feedback_node\", \"llm_agent\")  # Loop back for refinement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚡ 5. **Streaming and Async**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph supports streaming outputs using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async for step in graph.astream(state):\n",
    "    print(step)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal for **real-time agents**, **chatbots**, or **human-in-the-loop** workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 👥 6. **Multi-Agent Architecture (Advanced)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build multi-agent systems where:\n",
    "- Each agent is a node\n",
    "- They communicate by passing messages through the shared state\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes LangGraph **perfect for collaborative agent frameworks**, RAG systems, or tool-chaining.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 How LangGraph Implements This\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Define a State**\n",
    "\n",
    "The state is the \"memory\" of the graph. You can define a TypedDict or use a Python `dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    user_input: str\n",
    "    intent: str\n",
    "    response: str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Create Nodes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node is a function that takes `state` and returns updated `state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def classify_intent(state):\n",
    "    prompt = f\"What is the intent of: '{state['user_input']}'?\"\n",
    "    intent = some_llm(prompt)\n",
    "    state[\"intent\"] = intent\n",
    "    return state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Add Conditional Edges**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can dynamically route to different nodes using **conditional edges**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def router(state):\n",
    "    if state[\"intent\"] == \"search\":\n",
    "        return \"search_node\"\n",
    "    elif state[\"intent\"] == \"generate\":\n",
    "        return \"generate_node\"\n",

    "        return \"fallback_node\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔀 Control Flow Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Sequential Flow**\n",
    "Default behavior: execute nodes in order from entry to exit.\n",

    "graph.set_entry_point(\"step1\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 **Looping**\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow a loop (e.g., user feedback → retry), connect a later node back to a previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"feedback_node\", \"user_input_node\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ **Branching (Conditional Edges)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use conditional functions to branch to different nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\"decision_node\", router_function, {\n",

    "### 🔀 **Single-path vs. Multi-path Logic in LangGraph**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph gives you the flexibility to control **how your application flows** through different steps (or nodes) by using **graph-based logic**. This logic can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single-path** (linear, deterministic)\n",
    "* **Multi-path** (conditional, branching, dynamic)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ **Single-path Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **single-path logic**, your flow always moves **from one node to the next in a fixed sequence**, like a traditional function call chain or pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear flow\n",
    "* No conditional branching\n",
    "* Predictable and easy to debug\n",
    "* Best for simple workflows (e.g., input → transform → output)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"step1\", step1_func)\n",

    "### 🧠 **State Object Design in LangGraph**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph applications use a **shared state object** to manage memory, pass variables, and maintain context as the workflow moves between nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **core** to how LangGraph works — the state is passed from node to node and modified along the way, like a memory snapshot of your entire workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 1. What is a State Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **state** in LangGraph is a Python dictionary (`dict`) that stores:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🧠 Memory (conversation history, intermediate results)\n",
    "* 🔢 Variables (user input, LLM outputs, flags)\n",
    "* ⚙️ Internal logic indicators (like routing keys, tool results)\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s the **single source of truth** that flows through each step (node) of your graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧬 2. How is State Passed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function in a LangGraph node **receives and returns** this state.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_node(state: dict) -> dict:\n",
    "    state[\"step_result\"] = some_function()\n",
    "    return state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🧮 5. Memory in State\n",
    "\n",
    "For chatbots or agents, memory is handled by storing previous messages in state:\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
