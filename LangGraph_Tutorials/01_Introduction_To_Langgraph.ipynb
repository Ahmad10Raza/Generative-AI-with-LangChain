    "#### ‚úÖ What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** is an **open-source framework** built on top of [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) that allows developers to define **stateful, multi-step workflows** using a **graph-based architecture**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create **event-driven**, **multi-agent**, or **multi-step** LLM applications.\n",
    "* Handle **complex decision-making**, **memory**, and **control flow** elegantly.\n",
    "* Enable **state persistence** across multiple executions or loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üîÑ Think of LangGraph as a **state machine for LLM apps**, where each node is a step or task, and the edges determine the flow based on output or state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üí° Core Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Graph-based architecture**: Model agents, tools, and logic as nodes.\n",
    "* **State management**: Automatically track memory or any variables in the graph state.\n",
    "* **Multi-agent design**: Easily define roles, message passing, and collaboration.\n",
    "* **Looping and branching**: Supports dynamic loops and conditional branches.\n",
    "* **Async streaming**: Enables real-time response streaming.\n",
