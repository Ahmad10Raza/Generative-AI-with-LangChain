    "LangChain is an **open-source framework** aimed at simplifying the development of applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)**. It provides tools and abstractions to make building LLM-driven applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and document analysis systems easier and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modular Architecture:** It uses a modular approach, with components representing common steps and concepts for working with LLMs. These components can be \"chained\" together to build complex applications.\n",
    "* **Language Support:** Currently available in both Python and JavaScript versions, making it accessible to a broader developer community.\n",
    "* **Improved LLM Interaction:** LangChain simplifies user input processing, prompting, and response formatting for enhanced LLM communication.\n",
    "* **Data Integrations:** Allows integration with external data sources and APIs, like Apify Actors, Google Search, and Wikipedia, to enrich LLM responses.\n",
    "* **Memory Management:** Offers a dedicated memory library for storing chat histories and context, enabling more intelligent and personalized applications.\n",
    "* **Lower Development Barrier:** By abstracting away complex NLP tasks, LangChain empowers developers of all skill levels to build LLM-driven applications.\n",
